#AWSSI

[Not updated for 2015-16 winter]

A project done for Frank Marsik of UMich's Climate and Space department.

Processes weather data from national weather stations and calculates winter severity according to the 
Accumulated Winter Season Severity Index (AWSSI), then generates plots of the data overlayed with extremely
harsh and extremely mild winters.

This repo includes input data from the University of Michigan's weather station as well as the calculated data
and generated plots, dating from 1881 to 2015.
